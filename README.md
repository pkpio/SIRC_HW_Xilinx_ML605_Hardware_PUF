SIRC_HW_Xilinx_ML605_Hardware_PUF
=================================

Implementation of SIRC, hardware end code for a Xilinx virtex 6 ML605 device. This project is made to work with a actual hardware PUF. PUF - Physically Unclonable Function.

Network configuration

1. Disable Realtek PCI (or Broadcom) network. Only one of them but not both. It worked for me with Realtek disabled
2. Check if LAN wire is connected to Broadcom
3. IPv4 settings for Broadcom
  ip		: 		192.168.137.1
	Subnet mask 	: 		255.255.255.0
	Default gateway :		 . . . .
	DNS server	:		 . . . . (both)
4. Go to advanced in IPv4 --> 	Add IP address
	ip	: 192.168.1.10
	subnet	: 255.255.255.0
5. Make sure Microsoft Loopback Adapter is enabled (one of the 3 availble networks)
6. Go to IPv4 for Microsoft Loopback --> Obtain an IP address auto --> Use the following DNS server
	preferred	:	10.128.92.32
	alternate	:	10.129.92.32
7. Program the board via Jtag before attempting to send software commmands on the FPGA reboot (U always missed this !)


NOTE	:	A few steps above may not be required but with this settings its working for me.

We may enable the other network once we do a software connection.
It doesn't effect until the next board or network reboot or connections change.
This is essential as we need to verify license to compile and generate new program files
